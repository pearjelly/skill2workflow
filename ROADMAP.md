# Roadmap

This roadmap turns the approved `skill2workflow` design into an open-source delivery plan. It is intentionally organized around small closed loops: every milestone should produce runnable commands, tests, and a concrete artifact that future contributors can inspect.

The execution source of truth remains the Workflow DSL. LiteGraph and future UI layers are editors and views, not runtime authorities.

## Current Status

`main` now contains a runnable local harness. It demonstrates the five-layer architecture in local form and proves the core product direction: standard Agent skills can be compiled into workflow definitions that are controlled by a durable execution and control-plane layer.

Current capability snapshot:

- Skill ingestion: `SKILL.md` frontmatter, hard gates, and ordered checklist steps become Skill IR
- DSL authority: Skill IR compiles to Workflow DSL, with JSON Schema and structured validation errors
- Visual layer: Workflow DSL renders to LiteGraph JSON, and safe visual edits can write back to DSL
- Runtime: local executor supports run state, human-gate pause/resume, run listing, and run detail
- Control plane: immutable workflow publish, version lifecycle, published-version runs, resume, audit log, and filtered audit queries
- Durability: JSON/JSONL remains the dependency-light default; SQLite is available for run state, workflow registry metadata, and audit events
- Connector runtime: built-in manual and HTTP connector manifests, `tool_call` binding validation, HTTP execution, and connector audit events
- Authoring experience: example workflow gallery, richer LiteGraph inspector fields, safe action/retry/HTTP request write-back, and authoring docs
- Open-source readiness: contributor guide, issue templates, release notes, Workflow DSL compatibility policy, and stability boundaries
- Local control-plane UI: read-only snapshot export and static inspector for workflows, runs, audit events, connectors, and version comparisons
- Release automation: read-only release preflight checks, CI dry-run coverage, and maintainer release-process docs

Important boundaries:

- Published workflow artifacts remain immutable JSON documents in both storage modes.
- The visual graph is an editor/view. Workflow DSL remains the execution truth source.
- Connector runtime is an MVP boundary. Enterprise credential management, connector marketplaces, and product-specific connectors remain later work.
- Visual write-back is allowlisted. Topology, node ids, transition targets, and connector identity remain DSL-controlled.
- `0.1.x` compatibility is documented for Workflow DSL `0.1.0`; undocumented internals remain experimental.

## Active Roadmap

Future work should stay in small closed loops. A loop is complete only when it has a CLI path, tests, documentation, and a merged PR.

Post-`v0.1.0` work has four priorities:

1. make releases repeatable,
2. make real enterprise workflow examples easy to inspect,
3. harden connector behavior without overbuilding a marketplace,
4. improve local operator visibility while keeping Workflow DSL authoritative.

### Loop 16: Workflow Example Pack

Goal: make real enterprise workflow scenarios easy to inspect beyond the approval and HTTP connector fixtures.

Status: next engineering loop.

Scope:

- Add representative `SKILL.md` examples for sales follow-up, customer service escalation, risk review, and operations analysis
- Compile and commit matching Workflow DSL fixtures for each scenario
- Generate LiteGraph fixtures so examples are immediately inspectable in the static editor
- Add example documentation that explains the business process, control points, and expected runtime behavior
- Keep all examples dependency-free and local-first

Acceptance criteria:

- Each example skill compiles to valid Workflow DSL
- Each workflow fixture validates through the structured validator
- Each LiteGraph fixture opens in the existing editor without making the visual graph authoritative
- Example docs make the enterprise control value clear: required order, gates, state, and auditability

Loop 16 implementation slices:

1. Scenario selection
   - Pick four enterprise examples that show different control patterns rather than four copies of the same approval flow.
2. Example skill authoring
   - Write realistic `SKILL.md` inputs with hard gates, checklist steps, and clear human or connector boundaries.
3. Fixture generation
   - Compile, validate, and visualize every example through the existing CLI.
4. Example gallery docs
   - Link the examples from authoring docs and README so contributors can inspect them quickly.

Loop 16 explicit non-goals:

- Do not add product-specific enterprise connectors.
- Do not change Workflow DSL semantics solely for an example.
- Do not make LiteGraph JSON the execution source of truth.

## Near-Term Loop Queue

This queue is ordered by what most improves open-source adoption after the first release. Treat it as a planning queue, not a commitment to implement all items without review.

| Loop | Status | Goal | Expected artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loop 16: Workflow Example Pack | Next | Show enterprise scenarios beyond approval and HTTP examples | validated example skills/workflows for sales, customer service, risk review, and operations analysis |
| Loop 17: Connector Runtime Hardening | Planned | Improve connector reliability without adding external services | retry/timeout policy coverage, connector fixture harness, clearer credential boundary docs |
| Loop 18: Control Plane Operator UX | Planned | Connect control-plane state back to visual inspection | local server or static artifact flow for run/audit overlays and workflow artifact diffs |

Loop selection rules:

- Pick the next loop only after the previous loop is merged or explicitly deferred.
- Keep implementation local-first and dependency-light unless a spec-backed capability requires otherwise.
- Prefer examples and guardrails that make the current runtime easier to trust before adding new platform surface area.

## Release Tag Plan

Release tags use semantic versioning. The first public tag is `v0.1.0`; it packages the current local bootstrap through Loop 13, including parser, compiler, validator, LiteGraph editor, durable runtime, local control plane, SQLite durability, connector runtime, authoring experience, open-source readiness, and the local control-plane inspector.

### v0.1.0: First Open-Source Bootstrap Release

Status: published in Loop 14.

Release source:

- Branch: `main`
- Tag: `v0.1.0`
- Release: `https://github.com/pearjelly/skill2workflow/releases/tag/v0.1.0`
- Notes: `docs/releases/v0.1.0.md`
- Compatibility: Workflow DSL `0.1.0`, Python 3.9+, standard-library runtime

Release checklist:

- Release preflight passes for the target version and release notes
- Full unit suite passes
- Python modules compile
- Example Workflow DSL fixtures validate
- Release notes match the shipped scope
- Tag and GitHub release are created from the same clean `main`

After this tag, future `0.1.x` releases should be patch-level hardening and docs updates unless they preserve Workflow DSL `0.1.0` compatibility.

## Capability Milestones

The numbered capability milestones below are product roadmap buckets, not already-created Git tags. The first tag, `v0.1.0`, intentionally includes all completed local bootstrap capability buckets through Loop 13.

- Better LiteGraph parameter forms
- Example workflow gallery
- Expanded safe write-back beyond title and description
- Contributor docs for node types and compiler rules
- Future: node creation flows, schema-backed forms, and run/audit overlays in the editor

### v0.5: Local Control Plane UI

Status: first MVP shipped in Loop 13. Future work should connect run/audit overlays back into the graph view.

- Workflow registry view
- Run list and run detail view
- Audit log view
- Connector manifest view
- Published workflow version comparison
- Future: live local server mode, graph overlays, and workflow artifact diff views

### v1.0: Production Baseline

Target: support real team pilots while keeping the project local-first and open-source friendly.

- Stable Workflow DSL
- Stable CLI
- Local runtime and control plane suitable for real team pilots
- Extension points documented for nodes, compiler rules, executors, and connectors

## Contribution Lanes

Contributors can help in these areas:

- Parser coverage for real-world `SKILL.md` formats
- Release automation and package verification
- Workflow node types and compiler rules
- Validator improvements and JSON Schema
- LiteGraph node UI and expanded graph-to-DSL write-back
- Executor policies such as retry, timeout, and checkpoint behavior
- Connector manifests and example connectors
- Example workflows for sales, approval, customer service, risk review, and operations analysis
- Documentation and enterprise deployment guides

## Not Yet In Scope

These are intentionally deferred until the local open-source runtime is stronger:

- Cloud-hosted multi-tenant control plane
- Full RBAC or IAM
- Complete BPMN compatibility
- Distributed scheduling
- Complex enterprise connector marketplace
- Guaranteed automatic conversion of arbitrary SOP documents

## Roadmap Rules

- Every milestone must keep the Workflow DSL as the execution truth source.
- Every runtime or compiler change needs tests before behavior changes.
- Every new user-facing capability should have a CLI path before it becomes UI-only.
- Prefer small closed loops over broad platform shells.
- Avoid runtime dependencies unless they directly unlock a spec-backed capability.
