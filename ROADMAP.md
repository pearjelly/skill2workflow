# Roadmap

This roadmap turns the approved `skill2workflow` design into an open-source delivery plan. It is intentionally organized around small closed loops: every milestone should produce runnable commands, tests, and a concrete artifact that future contributors can inspect.

The execution source of truth remains the Workflow DSL. LiteGraph and future UI layers are editors and views, not runtime authorities.

## Current Status

`main` now contains a runnable local harness. It demonstrates the five-layer architecture in local form and proves the core product direction: standard Agent skills can be compiled into workflow definitions that are controlled by a durable execution and control-plane layer.

Current capability snapshot:

- Skill ingestion: `SKILL.md` frontmatter, hard gates, and ordered checklist steps become Skill IR
- DSL authority: Skill IR compiles to Workflow DSL, with JSON Schema and structured validation errors
- Visual layer: Workflow DSL renders to LiteGraph JSON, and safe visual edits can write back to DSL
- Runtime: local executor supports run state, human-gate pause/resume, run listing, and run detail
- Control plane: immutable workflow publish, version lifecycle, published-version runs, resume, audit log, and filtered audit queries
- Durability: JSON/JSONL remains the dependency-light default; SQLite is available for run state, workflow registry metadata, and audit events
- Connector runtime: built-in manual and HTTP connector manifests, `tool_call` binding validation, HTTP execution, and connector audit events
- Authoring experience: example workflow gallery, richer LiteGraph inspector fields, safe action/retry/HTTP request write-back, and authoring docs
- Open-source readiness: contributor guide, issue templates, release notes, Workflow DSL compatibility policy, and stability boundaries

Important boundaries:

- Published workflow artifacts remain immutable JSON documents in both storage modes.
- The visual graph is an editor/view. Workflow DSL remains the execution truth source.
- Connector runtime is an MVP boundary. Enterprise credential management, connector marketplaces, and product-specific connectors remain later work.
- Visual write-back is allowlisted. Topology, node ids, transition targets, and connector identity remain DSL-controlled.
- `0.1.x` compatibility is documented for Workflow DSL `0.1.0`; undocumented internals remain experimental.

## Active Roadmap

Future work should stay in small closed loops. A loop is complete only when it has a CLI path, tests, documentation, and a merged PR.

### Loop 13: Local Control Plane UI

Goal: give the local runtime an inspectable operator surface.

Status: next engineering loop.

Scope:

- Workflow registry view
- Run list and run detail view
- Audit log view
- Published workflow version comparison
- Local-only static UI or dependency-light web surface aligned with the existing harness

Acceptance criteria:

- Users can inspect published workflows, runs, and audit events without manually reading JSON files
- The UI uses existing control-plane commands or storage APIs and does not create a second execution truth source
- Tests and docs cover the new inspection path

## Version Milestones

### v0.1: Bootstrap Harness

Status: delivered by Loops 1-9.

- Parser, compiler, validator, executor, LiteGraph view, write-back, control plane, JSON/SQLite durability
- Suitable for local evaluation and early contributor onboarding

### v0.2: Connector Runtime

Status: first MVP shipped in Loop 10. Future work should harden connector ergonomics and product-specific extensions.

- Connector manifests
- Connector binding validation
- Manual and HTTP connector implementations
- Connector execution audit events
- Connector test fixtures
- Future: connector credentials, retries/timeouts per connector, and product-specific connector packages

### v0.3: Authoring Experience

Status: first MVP shipped in Loop 11. Future work should improve editor ergonomics and broaden safe write-back only where semantics are explicit.

- Better LiteGraph parameter forms
- Example workflow gallery
- Expanded safe write-back beyond title and description
- Contributor docs for node types and compiler rules
- Future: node creation flows, schema-backed forms, and run/audit overlays in the editor

### v0.4: Open Source Release Baseline

Status: first MVP shipped in Loop 12. Future work should add release automation after the tag workflow is settled.

- CONTRIBUTING guide
- Issue templates
- First release notes
- Workflow DSL `0.1.0` compatibility notes
- Clear stable vs experimental API boundaries
- Future: automated GitHub release workflow and signed release artifacts

### v0.5: Local Control Plane UI

Status: next milestone, starting with Loop 13.

- Workflow registry view
- Run list and run detail view
- Audit log view
- Published workflow version comparison

### v1.0: Production Baseline

Target: support real team pilots while keeping the project local-first and open-source friendly.

- Stable Workflow DSL
- Stable CLI
- Local runtime and control plane suitable for real team pilots
- Extension points documented for nodes, compiler rules, executors, and connectors

## Contribution Lanes

Contributors can help in these areas:

- Parser coverage for real-world `SKILL.md` formats
- Workflow node types and compiler rules
- Validator improvements and JSON Schema
- LiteGraph node UI and expanded graph-to-DSL write-back
- Executor policies such as retry, timeout, and checkpoint behavior
- Connector manifests and example connectors
- Example workflows for sales, approval, customer service, risk review, and operations analysis
- Documentation and enterprise deployment guides

## Not Yet In Scope

These are intentionally deferred until the local open-source runtime is stronger:

- Cloud-hosted multi-tenant control plane
- Full RBAC or IAM
- Complete BPMN compatibility
- Distributed scheduling
- Complex enterprise connector marketplace
- Guaranteed automatic conversion of arbitrary SOP documents

## Roadmap Rules

- Every milestone must keep the Workflow DSL as the execution truth source.
- Every runtime or compiler change needs tests before behavior changes.
- Every new user-facing capability should have a CLI path before it becomes UI-only.
- Prefer small closed loops over broad platform shells.
- Avoid runtime dependencies unless they directly unlock a spec-backed capability.
